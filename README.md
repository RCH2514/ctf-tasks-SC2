At first glance, this seemed like a straightforward social engineering challenge but with a twist. The key was to analyze the comments on the person’s social media posts.
Approach
To solve the challenge, I first used Google Lens on the provided photo, which led me to the person’s Twitter account. After browsing through their tweets, I found one where they asked if anyone wanted to get drunk with them. I then checked the comments on that tweet and discovered a conversation where the person mentioned they both liked the band Cinderella.
