About a month before Levandowski resigned, he connected his laptop to an important server that housed Googleâ€™s intellectual property. 
During this time, he downloaded approximately 14,000 files and copied them to an external drive, which he password-protected. 
To cover his tracks, he deleted all traces of his actions.
 However, we discovered a suspicious zip file on his laptop named "personalinformation.zip."
 Can you help find the password to the external drive containing the stolen data?
